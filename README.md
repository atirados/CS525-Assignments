### Description

This scripts reads two files containing information about two tables and then calculates their Cartesian Product, Natural Join or Left Outer Join.

The files must be in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, with the attributes on the first line and the tuples in the consecutive lines.

###     How to run      

To run the program, from a terminal change to the files directory (hw1.py and both .csv files).

Then, execute the following command:
'python hw1.py -m [mode of operation] -a [first .csv file] -b [second .csv file]'

The mode of operation is either [cartesian], [natural], or [outer].

To get information about the mode of operation, you can also run:
'python hw1.py -h'
This command will show helpful information about how to run the file.
